# MAGIC # Gold — Airport Dimension
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Builds `airline_operations.gold.dim_airport` from every distinct ICAO code present in the silver VRA table, left-joined to the ANAC aerodrome registry. Airports not in the ANAC cadastre (foreign airports) receive a fallback name and are flagged `in_anac_registry = false`. Serves both origin and destination of the fact table.
